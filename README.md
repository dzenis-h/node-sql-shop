## Node SQL Shop 🛒

## Overview 👀

Node SQL Shop is a simplified clone of the Node Book Shop app built for the sole purpose of practicing MySQL + Sequelize ORM. All of the other projects by the author are using NoSQL DB's, but the learning never stops. This app allows users to browse, add, edit, and delete products and orders using a relational database.
